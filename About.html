    <h1>The History of the White Glove Lady Cafe</h1>
    <p class="tab">EST: 2020, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) was our biggest nightmare, but it did not stop us from opening a cafe during a pandemic. Moreover, this is just to bring calmness, like a lavender coffee drink, or to start your day with a starter fluid shot, or just to even hit the NOS and go full throttle on Super Charger drink! (How insane can you be if you can create your own??) </p>
    <P class="tab">The reason behind the White Glove Lady is safety and cleanness. This little cafe is to unite everyone, anyone, old generations, mid generations, new generations, and many different people of who they are. We are openly acceptable of anyone as who they are, but rule of the thumb, you cannot judge who you see, therefore you don’t know their story because it is their story - not yours. </P>
    <p class="tab">“If You Do Not Have Nothing Nice to Say, Don’t Say Anything at All. And Bless Their Hearts, they are Just a Bunch of Assholes” - Mom Carol Sullivan</p>
    <p class="tab">We had set up the shop where people can feel accepted for who they are, the antique location - brings back memories, mid generation - brings back memories as well, and the new generation - where memories are made to be created. </p>
    <p>
        <center><u>We are an equal opportunity cafe shop and accepts all life forms.</u></center>
